i need to add a whole bunch of stuff This is a game I've been working on It's like a mini project which might turn into a big project it will get even bigger. My goal is to make a fun little cozy farming sim i'm basing this game off forger / Islanders. I got the inspo for this game from a post and then a week later I played a game, Islanders, which was a remake of, forager, another game I've played which I love so bringing farming sims and foragers if you can help at all that'd be a huge thingthis is also up on forms so check that out too!
